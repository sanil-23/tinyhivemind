//! How a seat's turn runs, and how its calls come back: the one seam.
//!
//! The host loop in `conducted.rs` owns the journal, the lanes, the briefs and
//! the driver. It touches the seat itself at three points only -- open a
//! turn, run it, close it and take what was called -- and the first and last
//! are the same for every embedding, because [`EpisodeTools`] is where a call
//! lands whichever road it took. What genuinely varies is [`SeatRunner::turn`]:
//! whether a seat is an `openhuman-embed` agent reaching its tools over MCP,
//! or a raw OpenHuman session handed the same tools natively. Both implement
//! this trait, and the loop cannot tell them apart.
