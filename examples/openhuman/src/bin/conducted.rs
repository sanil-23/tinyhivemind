//! One completion-driven episode, conducted over real OpenHuman agents.
//!
//! The point of this binary is not the task. It is the shape of the host:
//! the room's tools are served by `tinyhivemind-mcp`, the loop is
//! `tinyhivemind-openhuman`'s driver stepped the way a host steps it --
//! propose a round, run it, commit what it said, report delivery, repeat until
//! quiescent -- and what is written here is only what a host owns: agents,
//! a journal, sessions, and the prompt a turn is shown.
//!
//! How a seat's turn *runs* is behind one seam, [`conducted::runner::SeatRunner`],
//! with two implementations: `openhuman-embed` agents reaching the tools over
//! MCP ([`conducted::embed`], the default), and raw `OpenHumanSessionHost`
//! sessions handed the same tools natively ([`conducted::raw`]). The loop
//! cannot tell them apart; `TINYHIVEMIND_RUNNER=raw` picks the second.
//!
//! ```sh
//! set -a; . ~/.config/tinyhivemind/live.env; set +a
//! TINYHIVEMIND_LIVE_OPENROUTER=1 cargo run --manifest-path examples/openhuman/Cargo.toml --bin conducted
//! # Offline, either runner runs against a scripted model as a proof of its mechanics:
//! TINYHIVEMIND_RUNNER=raw cargo run --manifest-path examples/openhuman/Cargo.toml --bin conducted
//! # And both, N episodes each, as one table of what the harness costs:
//! CONDUCTED_BENCH=5 cargo run --release --manifest-path examples/openhuman/Cargo.toml --bin conducted
