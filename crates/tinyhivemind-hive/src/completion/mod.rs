//! Completion-driven episodes over explicit agent tool events.
//!
//! This is an alternative to [`crate::episode`], not another termination rung
//! inside it. The host opens a state with the agents it assigned, records an
//! agent's `complete_episode` call with [`apply_completion`], and records the
//! accepted recipients of a semantically routed broadcast with
//! [`apply_assignment`]. No prose, quorum, or turn count is interpreted.
//!
//! A participant holds an **append-only history** of assignments and at most
//! one of them is open. Appending rather than overwriting is what keeps the
//! evidence that an earlier assignment completed, which is what makes
//! [`CompletionEpisodeState::settled`] a quantity that only ever rises; the
//! refusal is what makes "at most one open" a checked precondition rather than
//! host discipline. See
//! `docs/adr/0021-an-assignment-is-appended-rather-than-overwritten.md`.
