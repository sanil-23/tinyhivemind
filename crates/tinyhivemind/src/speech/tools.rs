//! The room's tool surface, stated once, as data.
//!
//! A host renders these into whatever its agents call — a JSON schema over
//! MCP, an implementation of a tool trait, a function registry. Nothing here
//! is JSON, because JSON handling is not in this crate's dependency graph and
//! a schema is not the only shape a host needs.
//!
//! The descriptions are contract text rather than documentation. They are the
//! only place a seat is told that what it writes outside a tool call reaches
//! nobody, and the only place it is told that `complete_episode` is different
//! from one more `post`. A host renders them verbatim.
//!
//! The names here are bare. A host that namespaces its tools — an MCP server
//! called `desk` serving `post` presents it as `desk_post` — prefixes them,
//! and the descriptions are written to read correctly either way.
