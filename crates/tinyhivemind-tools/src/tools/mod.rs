//! What the server remembers between calls, and hands the host.
//!
//! Four things, all per seat: the turn the host has registered (which chat and
//! thread it is in), the calls the seat has made during it, the refusals it was
//! given, and the window of recent rows the host last refreshed for `read`.
//! The host writes the first and last and drains the middle two; the server
//! writes the middle two and reads the others. Nothing here reaches back into
//! the host.
//!
//! A poisoned lock is recovered rather than propagated: what it guards is a
//! map a panicking writer can only have left one entry short, and losing one
//! seat's call is strictly better than losing every seat's server.
