//! What the completion driver's policy costs, measured rather than asserted.
//!
//! Every arm runs the same rooms through the same `CompletionDriver` under a
//! different policy, so a difference is a difference in one thing. Nothing
//! here needs a model, a provider or a credential: the room is stochastic and
//! the router returns well-formed evaluations, so real acceptance still runs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --release -p tinyhivemind-openhuman --example bench
//! cargo run --release -p tinyhivemind-openhuman --example bench -- --episodes 2000 --members 8
//! ```
//!
//! # Why there is no `gate` arm
//!
//! The prototype this replaces priced "busy means unreachable" against
//! "busy means queued" and found gating discards a tenth of its routing
//! spend. The driver is the queue path; gating is not a policy it offers, so
//! it is not an arm here. `docs/experiments/2026-09-21-what-the-host-loop-costs.md`
//! keeps that measurement.
//!
//! # How concurrency is modelled
//!
//! A turn takes up to `latency` ticks and a routing call up to `route_latency`
//! more, and every row a wave produces is committed in order of when it would
//! have landed. A broadcast that lands before its recipient's completion meets
//! a working seat and is queued; one that lands after meets a settled seat and
//! is assigned. That is the whole situation the queue exists for, and ordering
//! by landing time reproduces it deterministically without a task per turn.

// A benchmark, not a library: a lost decimal here ends a measurement rather
// than a host's episode, so the lints that guard production paths are relaxed
// in this example the way they are in the crate's own tests.
