//! The embed runner: `openhuman-embed` agents, with the room's tools on
//! their belt.
//!
//! This is the runner the live episodes in `docs/experiments/` were recorded
//! with. A seat is an `AgentSpec` on the runtime, and there are two roads to
//! the same tools: [`EmbedRunner::seat`] hands them to the spec itself
//! through `AgentSpec::tools`, which is the default, and
//! [`EmbedRunner::seat_over_mcp`] reaches them through `OpenHuman`'s three
//! MCP dispatchers against `tinyhivemind-mcp`'s server. The second was the
//! only road before a spec could carry a belt of its own.
//!
//! A seat keeps one session for the whole episode and **seeds** it every turn
//! from the host's journal, as [`hosted`](crate::hosted) does: the rows it may
//! read, its persona at their head, and the turn's new rows in the brief.
//!
//! It used to resume that session instead, on the reasoning that `OpenHuman`'s
//! own continuity is what an `AgentSpec` seat has and a host's journal is a
//! second copy of it. What that cost: a resumed turn binds the session's
//! transcript the first time it commits, and the next turn is refused unless
//! its target is the *same binding* -- compared by pointer, against a locator
//! the runtime rebuilds per call. So every seat failed on its second turn with
//! `cannot change a transcript target after it is bound or committed`, and an
//! episode stalled the moment a seat spoke twice: a seat that asked and was
//! woken by the answer, a nudged seat, a seat refused a completion. Seeding
//! replaces resume rather than adding to it, so nothing binds and nothing is
//! compared.
//!
//! The runtime is the host's: it chooses the provider, the access tier and
//! the workspace. One thing it must say is [`EmbedRunner::services`]: without
//! MCP boot the subsystem never dials the episode's endpoint, and the seats
//! are never offered a tool at all, which reads exactly like a model
//! declining to call one.
