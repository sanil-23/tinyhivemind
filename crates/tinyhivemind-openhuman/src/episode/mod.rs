//! One episode, from its door to quiescence, over a journal the host owns.
//!
//! The [`Conductor`] holds every rule of a completion episode and the
//! [`SeatRunner`] runs a turn; between them sits the loop that moves rows
//! from the host's journal to a seat and back, one wave at a time:
//!
//! 1. `begin_wave`: the nudges due, appended.
//! 2. `turns`: who runs, where, above which row.
//! 3. For each turn: the rows the seat has not seen, read from the log as
//!    the seat; the record opened for the turn; the brief; the prompt the
//!    host composes; the turn started on the runner.
//! 4. Every turn awaited together, closed, and what it called recorded.
//! 5. `step` until settled: a commit appended and its sequence reported, a
//!    note appended, an event shown.
//!
//! [`run_episode`] is that loop. It reads through the host's [`SessionLog`]
//! and writes through [`Journal`], so a host implements the journal and
//! calls one function.
