//! First-class `OpenHuman` bindings for one host-owned `TinyHiveMind` desk.
//!
//! This crate owns the immutable relationship between canonical hive ids and
//! the handles a host binds to them -- already-instantiated
//! [`openhuman_embed::Agent`]s by default, or any [`BoundAgent`] a host that
//! runs its seats another way supplies. It proposes work
//! and folds host-committed utterances into caller-owned completion state; it
//! never stores a transcript, appends a row, or retains an `OpenHuman` session
//! id. The host creates the runtime and agents, executes proposed turns,
//! durably assigns sequences, and feeds those committed events back through
//! [`CompletionDriver`].
//!
//! This adapter is intentionally the OpenHuman-specific workspace boundary.
//! Its direct `openhuman-embed` dependency sets the root workspace Rust floor;
//! the pure `tinyhivemind-core` and `tinyhivemind-hive` dependency graphs stay
//! separate and continue to be checked as pure crates.
