//! What the episode itself has to tell a seat before its turn.
//!
//! A host owns everything about *who* a seat is -- its profile, its memory,
//! its company -- and puts that in front of the seat however it likes. What
//! the host cannot derive without re-reading the driver is what the episode
//! knows: the seat's open assignment, what is new for it, the conversations
//! it is in, what it is waiting on, what waits for it, and which channel
//! every tool call must name. [`EpisodeBrief`] is that, as a value, with a
//! default [`render`](EpisodeBrief::render) a host may use or replace.
//!
//! Nothing here reads storage. The host passes the rows a seat may see and
//! the conversations it was part of; the brief adds only what the state holds.
