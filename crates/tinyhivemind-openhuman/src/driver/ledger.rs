//! What the driver remembers between committed events that the episode fold
//! does not: queued handoffs, broadcast budgets, open questions, and how far
//! each seat has been shown.
//!
//! `CompletionEpisodeState` records who holds an assignment and who completed
//! one. It has no record of a handoff that could not be given yet, of how many
//! broadcasts an assignment has already spent, or of a question whose answer is
//! still owed. Those live here, beside the episode, and the [`Ledger`] is
//! advanced only by the same committed events -- so a persisted `DriverState`
//! carries it, and a crash between a completion and its queue drain loses
//! nothing the episode itself never recorded.
//!
//! [`Seen`] is different in kind: it is what the *host* reports about each
//! seat -- what it was shown, what it ran for. It moves the wake predicate, not
//! the episode, and a pending round stays valid across it.
